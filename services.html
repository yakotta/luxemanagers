        		<p>
					Luxe domestic staffing and placement is unlike any other domestic 
					staffing service. We have worked in private homes directly and understand 
					the ins and outs of every position in a private home setting. We are 
					able to draw on our expert firsthand knowledge to vet and select the 
					best candidates for each position we staff. It is so important to make 
					sure that there is a cohesive fit between staff and the household. We 
					make sure each position is tailored to the unique needs and desires of 
					every household, and then train, mentor, and evaluate staff members 
					through their entire candidacy and into their placement to ensure a 
					successful fit.
